# Node Mailer Application
### Project:-
In this project I have created a nodemailer application to provide engaging email sending experience while integrating an SMTP Email API for the functionality. Node.js frameworks like Express.js facilitate its integration, while JSON aids in data exchange, forming a robust email sending solution.
